        <b>Specification for transactions in postlock</b><br />
        PLEASE UPDATE THIS DOCUMENT IF THERE ARE CHANGES IN THE PROTOCOL<br />
        Author: Peter Neumark &lt;<i>neumark at postlock dot org</i>&gt;<br />

        <div class="toc"></div>
        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <h2>About postlock</h2>
        <p>Postlock is a system allowing processes running on different computers to access a globally shared state
        space without the need to explicitly lock objects or perform low-level synchronization. Postlock has an
        optimisitic concurrency model, meaning each client can modify the shared state without consulting with other
        clients or the server.<br />
        Each client maintains their own copy of the global state. Clients must apply changes to their local copy
        first. Once the local modification is complete, the changes are sent to the postlock server which broadcasts the changes to all clients, effectively making the changes global.
        </p>
        <h2>Transactions</h2>
        <p>Changes to global state are expressed as operations on data structures (an example would be
        <code>insert</code> on a list). In order to avoid corruption of the global state, these operations are grouped
        into transactions, which have traditional <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID">ACID properties</a>.
        The server places all incoming transactions into a queue, and runs them one at a time. Each transaction may
        succeed or fail depending on the current global state.
        </p>
        <h2>Operational transformations</h2>
        <p>
        Each client may send the server a transaction at any point in time. Client A will perform some local operation
        and send it to the server as a transaction. Simultaneously, Client B does the same. If B's transaction reaches
        the server before A's, and both clients perform operations on the same part of the global state, it is possible
        for A's transaction to be out of date. This means that applying A's transaction "as is" would yield a different
        state for the server than client A's local state after the operation. In order to fix client A's out of date
        transaction so its operations have the same result as they did for client A, 
        an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation">Operational
        Transformation</a>(OT) must be applied to the operations within A's transaction.
        </p>
        <h2>Related work</h2>
        <p>The concurrency model used by postlock is influenced by the implementation used by <a
        href="http://www.waveprotocol.org/whitepapers">google wave</a>. The fact that Wave was not a commerical success,
        is not due to the underlying technology, which is quite solid. For a more detailed explanation about how Wave
        uses OT, <a
        href="http://www.codecommit.com/blog/java/understanding-and-applying-operational-transformation">check out this
        article</a>. The field of OT is quite mature, preceding Wave by more than a decade. The most important
        publication in the discipline from Postlock's point of view is <a href="http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/215585.215706">High-latency, low-bandwidth windowing in the Jupiter collaboration system</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>Scope of this document</h2>
        <p>This document describes the transaction protocol used by postlock to propagate
        state change information between clients and the server. In particular, it addresses:
            <ol>
                <li>The semantics of transactions</li>
                <li>The message format used to encode transactions</li>
                <li>OT rules for the different data types used by postlock</li>
                <li>Success scenarios</li>
                <li>Failure scenarios</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <h2>Definition of terms</h2>
        <p>
            The following terms have specific meaning within postlock:
            <dl>
                <dt>server state</dt>
                    <dd>Like each client, the postlock server also has its own copy of global state. Each time the
                    server applies a transaction, it reaches a new state. The different versions of ther server's state
                    are identified by integers.</dd>
                <dt>unacknowledged state</dt>
                    <dd>After applying an operation, a client enters an unacknolwedged state. The client will remain in
                    the unacknowledged state until it receives either positive or negative acknolwedgement from the
                    server (after which it will enter a server state).</dd>
                <dt>transaction</dt>
                    <dd>A message with a pre-defined format containing a set of operations to be applied to a specific server state. If the receiver of the transaction
                    is in a different state than the one the transaction was created for, then the receiver must perform
                    OT to arrive at a transaction applicable in its current state.</dd>
                <dt>participant</dt>
                    <dd>A process connected to the postlock session which can exchange messages with the other participants.
                    All postlock clients are participants. The state server is also a participant.</dd>
            </dl>
        </p>

        <h1>Transaction semantics</h1>
        <h2>ACID properties</h2>
        <p>Transactions in postlock fulfill the ACID properties:
        <table>
            <tr><td>Atomicity</td><td>If any of the operations fail within a transaction, then the entire transaction is
            discarded and global state is not modified.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Consistency</td><td>Postlock makes few guarantees about the contents of its data types, but they
            are stricly enforced (eg. no dictionary may have two values attached to the same key).</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Isolation</td><td>Transactions are executed serially, the success of a transaction depends only on
            the current shared state.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Durability</td><td>Transactions are saved to Mnesia by postlock before they are executed, so
            postlock has the same durability properties as mnesia.</td></tr>
        </table>
        </p>
        <h2>How transactions work</h2>
        <p>
        To understand how transactions are created and executed, its useful to consider the entire chain of actions
        taken to ensure that all clients arrive at the same shared state. Let's consider a case where we have two
        clients, Alice and Bob, using an application which is built atop postlock:
        <ol>
            <li>Initially, the system is synchronized: each client is in the same state as the
            server. We will call this "server state 1".</li>
            <li>Alice clicks a button in the GUI of her postlock application.</li>
            <li>The application requests a change in local state through the postlock client API.</li>
            <li>The postlock client commits the operation locally and creates a transaction message which contains the
            details of the operation as well as the last state the client shared with the server ("server state 1").
            Alice's postlock client is now in "unacknowledged state 1".</li>
            <li>The newly created transactions is placed in the outgoing queue. Since there are no transactions awaiting
            acknowledgement, it is immediately sent to the state server, typically participant 1 in the postlock session.</li>
            <li>The server checks whether or not it needs to apply OT to the transaction before executing it. Since the
            transaction applies to "server state 1", which is the server's current state, it attempts to execute the
            transaction as it was received.</li>
            <li>The transaction is executed in a separate context so the server's state is not affected in the case of
            failure. If the transaction is successfully executed, the modified objects are copied from the transaction's
            context into the server's copy of global state, and the server's state is incremented to "server state 2".</li>
            <li>The server broadcasts the transaction it has applied to the other participants in the session. A field
            is added, which allows Alice's postlock client to identify the transaction as its own.</li>
            <li>Alice's client changes its state to "server state 2", and empties the outgoing transaction queue.</li>
            <li>Bob's client receives the transaction which will take its local copy of shared state to "server state
            2"</li>
            <li>Since Bob has no unacknowledged transactions, the transaction it received from the server can be applied
            as-is.</li>
            <li>After applying the transaction and modifying it's state revision to "server state 2", Bob's client calls
            a callback function in the application code, notifying it of the fact that an object in the shared state has
            been modified.</li>
            <li>The application is notified through the callback to update the GUI, and Bob sees Alice's
            modification</li>
            </li>
        </ol>
        The end-to end propogation of state change in postlock takes lots of small steps. This document describes:
        <ul>
            <li>The format of the transaction message created in step 4.</li>
            <li>The application of OT by the server in step 6.</li>
            <li>In step 7, the possible reasons for failure of a transaction, and the resulting actions of the server.</li>
            <li>The format of the server's outgoing transaction message in step 8, as well as the details of the
            broadcasting mechanism.</li>
            <li>The client's use of OT (would replace step 11 above).</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h1>Message format</h1>
        <p>
            Postlock uses the <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a> representation of data internally. Work is ongoing to allow clients to use
            other encodings (<a href="http://thrift.apache.org">thrift</a> for example). Still, the "official"
            representation of postlock messages is JSON, and all other formats must have clearly defined transformations
            which convert their data into JSON messages.
        </p>
        <h2>Postlock message</h2>
        <p>
            Transactions are standard postlock messages, and as such have the following format:
            <pre>
            {
                id: /* integer - message id */,
                from: /* integer - originating participant id */,
                to: /* integer - destination participant id */,
                type: 'transaction',
                body: /* transaction object format, see below */
            }
            </pre>
            Only the <code>body</code> field has a special format in transaction messages. The remaining fields are
            populated the same way as for any other message. It is recommended to use "transaction" as the type of
            transaction messages, but this is currently not enforced.<br />
            The body field has the following format:
            <pre>
            {
                in_response_to: /* string - optional - used for acknowledgment of transactions */,
                state_version: /* integer - identifies a version of server state */,
                ops: [ /* operation description */ ]
            }
            </pre>
            The <code>in_response_to</code> field has the format "participant id.message id", for example "5.2". That
            particular value indicates that the transaction encoded in the current message is actually the same
            transaction as the one sent by participant 5 with message id 2. The in_response_to field is necessary
            because the message sent by the server contains operations which have potentially been modified by OT. When
            participant 5 receives this message, it will not execute the enclosed operations (even if they look
            unfamiliar because of the OT), instead it will remove the transaction message with message id 2 from the
            outgoing transaction queue, since it has been acknowledged by the server.<br />
            The last field of the transaction body is a list of operation objects, which in turn have the following
            format:
            <pre>
            {
                oid: /* integer - optional - object id of subject of operation */
                cmd: /* string - command to run on object */
                params: [] /* arbitrary JSON data - optional */
            }
            </pre>
            Each postlock data type has a set of operations which can be used to modify its state. Invoking such an
            operation requires the oid field to be set and the cmd field to have the proper command name. The oid field
            is marked optional because it is not required for creation/deletion of objects (in which case the oid of the
            object will be in the params array).
            </p>
            <h3>Example postlock message</h3>
            <p>
            The acceptable list items in the params field depend on what type of command is executed. Typically, parameters
            are simple integers and strings, but in theory they could be arbitrarily complex JSON expressions.<br />
            The following example message is sent from a client to the state server and changes the contents of a data
            object:
            <pre>
            {
                id: 1,
                from: 3,
                to: 1,
                type: 'transaction',
                body: {
                    state_version: 1,
                    ops: [
                        {
                            oid: "0.0",
                            cmd: "set",
                            params: ["the new value"]
                        }
                    ]
                }
            }
            </pre>
            Assuming that the transaction was successfully executed, the server would broadcast the following message:
            <pre>
            {
                id: 6,
                from: 1,
                to: 7,
                type: 'transaction',
                body: {
                    in_response_to: "3.1",
                    state_version: 1,
                    ops: [
                        {
                            oid: "0.0",
                            cmd: "set",
                            params: ["the new value"]
                        }
                    ]
                }
            }
            </pre>
            The server's acknowledgement can have any message id &gt; the client's original message id. The
            <code>in_response_to</code> field contains the string "3.1" because the server's message is the
            acknolwedgement of a transaction message from participant 3 with an id of 1. The operations in the server's
            acknolwedgement are identical to the original transaction, but due to the use of OT by the server, this is
            not always the case.
            </p>
        <h1>Operational Transformation</h1>
        <p>
            Operations are applicable to a certain version of state. For example, <code>list.remove(1)</code> will
            no longer delete the same item from the list if it is preceded by a <code>list.insert(0, X)</code>. The
            Operational Transformation (OT) maps operations applicable in a given state to a different state in such a
            way that they still yield the same result.<br />
            Since each client maintains its own copy of shared state, clients will sometimes be in a different state
            than the server. Specifically, clients can be:
            <ol>
                <li><i>In a latter state than the state server</i> when the local client applies a user-initiated modification
                from the application on top of postlock through the client API. It sends the local modifications to the
                server in a transaction message. The server then broadcasts the acknowledgement of the transaction if it
                is successful, or returns an error message on failure. Once the client receives the server's response,
                it will again be in the same state as the server: if the transaction succeeded, then it will be in the
                next server state. Otherwise, it will roll back to the previous server state (undoing the user
                modification).</li>
                <li><i>In an earlier state than the state server</i> when the local client has not yet applied all of
                the transactions broadcast by the server. Once the client "catches up", it will again be in a server
                state.</li>
            </ol>
            In practice, clients are often both before <i>and</i> after the server state in the sense that they have
            unacknowledged local modifications and have not yet applied every transaction broadcast by the server.
            OT is needed any time a client or the server receives a transaction message which is based off a different
            state than what the recipient is in.
            The <i>how transactions work</i> section includes two places where OT may be necessary. There are actually
            three:
            <ul>
            <li>Upon receiving a server transaction, clients which have unacknolwedged local modifications must reverse
            these local operations with OT to recreate the server state in which the transaction can be applied.</li>
            <li>Upon receiving a client transaction which applies to a previous server state than the current one, the
            state server uses OT to make the client's out of date transaction applicable in the current state.</li>
            <li>If the postlock client receives a sequence of modification requests from the application, then they are
            all applied locally, but only the first change is sent to the server as a transaction message. The remaining
            change operations are inserted into the outgoing queue. They will be sent to the server once the previous
            transactions have been acknowledged (there can be only one transaction waiting for acknowledgement from the
            server). Since all transactions must have a <code>state_version</code> which refers to a server state, OT
            must be applied to the pending changes so they can be applied to a server state. Without the operational
            transformation, they could be applied to the client's unacknowledged state only.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h1>How the postlock server broadcasts messages</h1>
        <p>The basic postlock message delivery mechanism exchanges messages between two participants. In the case of
        transactions sent out by the state server, broadcast functionality is needed. This section describes how
        broadcast messages can be sent in postlock.</p>
        <h2>Participant groups</h2>
        <p>
        Maintaining the list of all participants connected to the session is the responsibility of the session server. In
        order to facilitate the implementation of message broadcast functionality, the session server also maintains
        lists which contain a subset of participants in the system. These <b>participant group</b>s can be used as the
        destination address for messages by the state server. The session server will then expand the participant group
        and deliver the state server's message to each participant in the group.<br />
        Each participant group is owned by a single postlock user. Only participants which log in as this user have the
        ability to modify the participant group. If a postlock client wishes to receive the broadcast messages sent by
        the state server, then it must send a join group request to the state server. The state server will in turn
        instruct the session server to add the given participant to the group.<br />
        Postlock shared state can be implemented even if only the state server can create and modify participant groups (in
        fact, a single participant group is enough). It makes sense, however, to offer this functionality to any user,
        so the applications built atop postlock can also broadcast messages. This requires all participant group related
        commands to be send as postlock message between the state server and the session server (since this is the only
        interface other clients have to the session server).
        </p>
        
        <h3>participant group example</h3>
        <p>
            The following example demonstrates which messages are exchanged between a client which has just joined the
            postlock session and the state server so the new client will receives broadcast state messages.
            Request sent by the client.
            <pre>
            {
                id:     10,
                from:   7,
                to:     1,
                type:   'connection-request',
                body: null
            }
            </pre>
            Upon receiving this message, the state server sends a message to the state server.
            <pre>
            {
                id:     15,
                from:   1,
                to:     0,
                type:   'participant-group',
                body: {
                    cmd: 'add',
                    params: [7]
                }
            }
            </pre>
            The session will respond by sending back the current state of the participant group:
            <pre>
            {
                id:     140,
                from:   0,
                to:     1,
                type:   'participant-group',
                body: {
                    members: [5,6, ..., 7]                
                }
            }
            </pre>
            Since participant 7 is not included in the participant group, the state server can send an acknolwedgement
            back to the client:
            <pre>
            {
                id:     710,
                from:   1,
                to:     7,
                type:   'connection-success',
                body: null
            }
            </pre>
            Manipulating participant group lists through standard postlock messages is slightly more cumbersome than
            using standard erlang techniques such as gen_server calls, but as soon as the messages which create
            participant groups are introduced, any postlock user can use them to broadcast messages. Some checks in the
            code are necessary which make sure creating too many participant groups cannot be used for DOS attacks.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Message identity</h2>
        <p>
            The <code>id</code> field of a postlock message is incremented for each outgoing message of a participant.
            Therefore, the (participant id, message id) double uniquely identifies a message body. Since a message's
            destination address can be a participant group instead of a participant id, in order to identify the entire
            message, the (participant id, message id, destination) triple is needed.<br />
            The significance of this is that the message id of outgoing transaction messages issued by the state server
            can be used to identify different server state version.
            <b>The integer which is associated with a given revision of the server state is the message id of the
            transaction message broadcast by the state server which results in that state.</b><br />
            For example, if the state server broadcasts the following transaction:
            <pre>
            {
                id: 110,
                from: 1,
                to: X,
                type: 'transaction',
                body: {
                    state_version: 100,
                    in_resonse_to: "7.34",
                    ops: [
                        {
                            cmd: "create",
                            params: [{
                                type: "data",
                                oid: "7.374",
                                value: "some data"
                            }]
                        }
                    ]
                }
            }
            </pre>
            Then the immediately following server state is state number 110. After applying this transformation, the
            clients will also be in server state 110. Note that the <code>state_version</code> field contains the
            version of state to which the transaction applies. <code>msg.body.state_version &lt; msg.id</code>.
