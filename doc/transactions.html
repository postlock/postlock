<h1>Transactions in postlock</h1>
<h2>Terms used in this document</h2>
This document relies on terms introduced in <a href="conflicts.html">conflicts.html</a>.<br />
<dl>
<dt>oid</dt><dd>Abbreviation of Object IDentity. A simple string with the format of "X.Y", where both X and Y are nonnegative integers. 
X is the id of the participant which created the object, while Y is a counter. OID's are guaranteed to be unique. </dd>
</dl>
<h2>Scope of this document</h2>
This document describes the process by which a postlock participant can modify shared state.
Emphasis is placed on the operational transform, which allows the server to run out of date transactions
unless they come into conflict with later transactions. Most of the examples in this file follow the simple template
of 
<ol>
<li>Client A sends the server a transaction.</li>
<li>Client B sends the server a transaction.</li>
<li>The server gets A's transaction, applies it, and notifies both clients (B discards the server's message, since
it no longer applies in B's current state).</li>
<li>The server gets B's transaction which is based on one state prior to the server's current state. It applies 
the operational transform to the message and -if successful- runs the resulting modified operations.</li>
</ol>
This is the <em>simplest</em> scenario in which operational transformations are necessary. More complex situations
are handled the same way (for example if several clients send transactions to the server before B's message arrives).
Generally OT is needed when the state server receives transactions with a starting state older than that state
server's current state. In the template above, the difference between the transaction's start state and the
state server's state is a single transaction. When the start state is several transactions behind the state server's
current state, then the postlock server applies the steps used in the following examples for each transaction. Thus,
the multiple transaction OT is simply a chain of OT's applied in sequence for each transaction which the sender of the
outdated transaction has not yet applied.
<h2>Operations in postlock</h2>
Shared state is a tree-like collection of postlock's managed data types (currently lists, dictionaries and data).
Each managed type has its own set of applicable operations.<br />
Changes are distributed among participants as <em>transactions</em>, which contain a list of <em>operations</em>.
Certain operations are guaranteed to be applicable in any state: for example, creating a new object of any type
will always work. Most operations either outright fail or require a transformation if another user applies the wrong
operations first. Examples:
<h3>Example 1: transaction failure in order to avoid data loss</h3>
The following example shows how operations which lead to data loss fail by default, preventing dangerous writes.
Let's assume a <code>data</code> object, with oid <code>0.0</code> exists, its contents initially set to <code>null</code>.
<ol>
    <li>Client A sets the state to be <code>1</code> with the following message:
        <pre>
            {
                from: 2 // Client A is 2
                to: 1   // the state server is 1
                type: transaction
                body: {
                    tid: "0:0.1",
                    ops: [{
                        oid: "0.0",
                        cmd: "set",
                        params: [1] // 'set' takes only one parameter, the new value.
                    }]
                }
            }
        </pre>
    </li>
    <li>Just as A's transaction reaches the state server, client B sends an operation which
        modifies the same object, but gives it a different value:
        <pre>
            {
                from: 3 // Client B is 3 
                to: 1   // the state server is 1
                type: transaction
                body: {
                    tid: "0:0.1",
                    ops: [{
                        oid: "0.0",
                        cmd: "set",
                        params: [2]
                    }]
                }
            }
        </pre>
    </li>
    <li>The state server gets A's message first, applies it, and notifies both clients. Naturally, B will 
        discard the message, since its state is no longer in 0 (the starting state for the transaction).
        Then, the state server gets B's message. It can see that B's message is slightly out of date, since
        the state server is in state 1 now, while B's transaction advances state only to 0.1.
    </li>
    <li>
        The state server transforms each operation in B's transaction to be applicable in its current state.
        The last transaction that touched object "0.0" in the state server is "0:1". B's transaction is
        "0:0.1", Since the ending state of B's transaction is older than the state of object in the state server,
        we know someone else has changed the object without B's knowledge. Allowing B's 'set' to continue
        would result in data loss.  As a result, B's set will fail.
    </li>
    <li>
        The state server must notify B of the transaction's outcome. It will construct a message that takes
        B's state back to 0, then on to 1 (undoing B's 0.1 state). A slight optimization is possible: instead
        of undoing <em>all</em> operations, only the operations not overridden by applied transactions are
        undone. In our example, the single operation 'set' is in fact overridden, so the state server issues
        a single set with the new value:
        <pre>
            {
                from: 1
                to: 3
                type: transaction
                body: {
                    tid: "0.1:1",
                    result: {
                        ok: false,
                        failed_op: 0,
                        reason: 102     // just an example error code, meant to indicate "out of date"
                    },
                    ops: [{
                        oid: "0.0",
                        cmd: "set",
                        params: [1]
                    }]
                }
            }
        </pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        Upon receiving the state server's response to its transaction, client B has two options. It can either
        decide to dicard its transaction, keeping "0.0" state 1. The other option is to re-run the transaction.
        Since B's state has been moved to 1, the transaction it now sends to the server will have a tid of "1:1.1",
        which will override client A's original transaction. The correct choice is determined by the application's
        logic, there is no innately correct action.
    </li>
</ol>
<h3>Example 2: failure due to conflict</h3>
Some transactions will fail because the operational transform is not possible. The following example demonstrates such a case.
The operations in this example will be applied on a <code>list</code> object (oid: 0.0) with initial value <code>["0.5", "0.1"]</code>.
Note: postlock lists only contain references to other postlock objects, no actual user data is present in a list directly.
<ol>
    <li>
        Client A sends the server a transaction which deletes both elements in the list:
        <pre>
            {
                from: 2,
                to: 1,
                type: transaction
                body: {
                    tid: "0:0.1",
                    ops: [{
                        oid: "0.0",
                        cmd: "remove",
                        params: [1]
                    },
                    {
                        oid: "0.0",
                        cmd: "remove",
                        params: [0]
                    }]
                }
            }
        </pre>
    </li>
    <li>Client B sends the server a transaction in which it attempts to append data object (oid: 3.7) to the list. Although
        the javascript API may expose an <code>append(item)</code> function, an <code>insert</code> command is
        sent in the transaction.
        <pre>
            {
                from: 3,
                to: 1,
                type: transaction
                body: {
                    tid: "0:0.1",
                    ops: [{
                        oid: "0.0",
                        cmd: "insert",
                        params: [2, "3.7"]
                    }]
                }
            }
        </pre>
    </li>
    <li>The usual step 3: the server receives and applies A's message, informs both clients (but B discards the message). 
        Then the server gets B's message, on which it must apply OT to make it applicable in the current state.
        The OT will try to map the old position 2 to a list to its new position. This will fail, as the lists length is
        currently 0.
    </li>
    <li>
        The state server must notify B of the transaction's outcome. The server's reply will
        undo B's <code>insert</code>, which moves B back to state 0, and the delete list items 1 and 2,
        which advances B's state to 1:
        <pre>
            {
                from: 1
                to: 3
                type: transaction
                body: {
                    tid: "0.1:1",
                    result: {
                        ok: false,
                        failed_op: 0,
                        reason: 103     // just an example error code, meant to indicate "no such list position"
                    },
                    ops: [{
                        oid: "0.0",
                        cmd: "remove",
                        params: [2]
                    },
                    {
                        oid: "0.0",
                        cmd: "remove",
                        params: [1]
                    },
                    {
                        oid: "0.0",
                        cmd: "remove",
                        params: [0]
                    }]
                }
            }
        </pre>
        Note: removing elements starting from the back of the list and moving towards the front is pretty straight forward. It's also possible to
        move in the opposite direction, this would require remove(0) operations. Although they look identical, each of them would remove a different
        element in the list.<br />
        Another thing to note: in practice, B's insert of object 3.7 will often be preceded by the creation of object 3.7. By placing the create and
        the insert in a single transaction, the rollback of the transaction (due to the insert's failure) will guarantee that the state space is
        not polluted with unused objects.
    </li>
</ol>
<h3>Example 3: Successfully applied OT</h3>
The following example demonstrates the flow of messages among postlock participants when one of the transactions received
by the state server is out of date and thus requires OT to be applied to the current state. The clients in this example
will operate on a <code>list</code> (oid: 0.0), with the initial value of ["1.1"].

<ol>
<li>Client A prepends item 2.1 to the list:
        <pre>
            {
                from: 2,
                to: 1,
                type: "transaction",
                body: {
                    tid: "0:0.1",
                    ops: [{
                        oid: "0.0",
                        cmd: "insert",
                        params: [0, "2.1"]
                    }]
                }
            }
        </pre>
</li>
<li>Client B appends an item (oid: 3.1) to the list:
        <pre>
            {
                from: 3,
                to: 1,
                type: "transaction",
                body: {
                    tid: "0:0.1",
                    ops: [{
                        oid: "0.0",
                        cmd: "insert",
                        params: [1, "3.1"]
                    }]
                }
            }
        </pre>
</li>
<li> The state server receives both messages. As a response to the first message, the state server sends
the following transactions:
    <pre>
            { // Acknowledgement of A's transaction.
                from: 1,
                to: 2, 
                type: "transaction",
                body: {
                    tid: "0.1:1",
                    result: {
                        ok: true,
                    },
                    ops: []
                }
            }

            { // Note: this message will be discarded by B.
                from: 1,
                to: 3, 
                type: "transaction",
                body: {
                    tid: "0:1",
                    ops: [{
                        oid: "0.0",
                        cmd: "insert",
                        params: [0, "2.1"]
                    }]
                }
            }
 
    </pre>
</li>
<li>Since the B's transaction has a start state of 0 and the state server's curernt state is 1, the server
will apply OT to the insert within B's transaction. Since the difference between the transaction's start state
(0) and the state server's current state (1) is an insert(0, ...) operation, any list positions in B's message
which are &gt; 0 must be incremented by 1.
<pre>
                        params: [1, "3.1"]  =&gt; params: [2, "3.1"]
                        state 2 for object 0.0: ["2.1", "1.1", "3.1"]
</pre>
</li>
<li>
The state server must notify both clients that B's transaction was successfully applied. It send B and acknowledgement of its transaction
and also re-transmit A's transaction so B will arrive in state 2. A will receive a transformed version of B's transaction which can
be applied in state 1:
<pre>
            {
                from: 1,
                to: 3,
                type: "transaction",
                body: {
                    tid: "0.1:2",
                    result: {
                        ok: true,
                    },
                    ops: [{         // note: in state 0.1, B's version of the list is ["1.1", "3.1"]
                        oid: "0.0",
                        cmd: "insert",
                        params: [0, "2.1"]
                    }]
                }
            }

            {
                from: 1,
                to: 2,
                type: "transaction",
                body: {
                    tid: "1:2",
                    ops: [{
                        oid: "0.0",
                        cmd: "insert",
                        params: [2, "3.1"]
                    }]
                }
            }
</pre>
How did the state server construct the reply sent to B? In order to bring B up to state 2, A's transaction must be applied,
but B can't apply it in it's original form, since B's state is 0.1, not 0 (the starting state of A's transaction). Again,
the state server must perform an OT which makes A's transaction applicable in B's 0.1 state.<br />
B's 0.1 state differs from state 0 by the <code>insert(1, "3.1")</code> (note that this is the operation applied by B locally,
not the version applied by the state server). Since list positions &lt; 1 are not affected, A's transaction needs no modification,
it can be sent as is.
