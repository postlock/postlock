<h1>Postlock Documentation</h1>
This is the current documentation for postlock. These files serve as both specifications for how postlock should be
built and as an API reference aimed at developers building postlock into their own applications. Please edit these files
<i>before</i> commiting changes to the <code>master</code> branch on github so that the documentation is always up to
date. In addition to these files, there is also a <a href="https://github.com/postlock/postlock/wiki">postlock wiki</a> on github
for content that is not specification/reference material.
<h1>About postlock</h1>
Postlock is a system allowing processes running on different computers to access a globally shared state
space without the need to explicitly lock objects or perform low-level synchronization. Postlock has an
optimisitic concurrency model, meaning each client can modify the shared state without consulting with other
clients or the server.<br />
Each client maintains their own copy of the global state. Clients must apply changes to their local copy
first. Once the local modification is complete, the changes are sent to the postlock server which broadcasts the changes to all clients, effectively making the changes global.

        <dd>Postlock acts as a message bus, allowing any two clients connected to the session to exchange messages
        asynchronously. This can be used even without postlock's shared state functionality. In fact, it may be the easiest way
        to get server-side programs to push messages into the users' browser (using websockets). Message broadcasting is also
        supported (although currently unimplemented) through the use of participant groups.</dd>
    <dt><a href="datatypes.html">Data types</a></dt>
        <dd>Postlock's shared state is composed of objects managed by postlock. These objects have a well-defined set of
        operations which can be used to alter them.</dd>
    <dt><a href="transactions.html">Transactions</a></dt>
        <dd>Transactions are messages exchanged between clients and the server which carry information about changes
        made to the local copies of postlock.
